### Getting started

The [README](README.md) contains instructions for installing and configuring the extension.

The insults are meant to be light-hearted and fun and as such the code of conduct in this repo is to be applied to anything added to this project.

Insults can be added to `src/Insults.php`. They shouldn't really be _too_ long.

Just because you add an insult, doesn't mean it'll be accepted. Or it might get removed later. That's my choice.
